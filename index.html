 <p>I am presently employed as an Embedded Software Developer at Infineon Technologies AG, located in Augsburg, Germany.
    I completed my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering (Automation and Robotics) from <a href="https://www.h-da.de/">Hochschule Darmstadt</a> in February 2016. During my academic journey,
    I had the opportunity to engage in a substantial internship at <a href="http://www.kuka-robotics.com/germany/de/">KUKA Roboter GmbH</a> in Augsburg. Before embarking on my master's program,
    I accrued over three years of experience as an Application Engineer at <a href="http://www.microchip.com/">Microchip Technology Inc</a>, based in Bangalore.

 <p>My professional journey has been marked by an unwavering passion for acquiring cutting-edge technological knowledge and crafting sophisticated embedded systems.
    I derive immense satisfaction from the act of coding and solving intricate challenges. My commitment to delivering excellence is a hallmark of my work ethic. 
	Over the course of my career, I have proficiently employed a diverse array of programming languages, including Embedded C, JavaCard, Python, C++, C#, Java, and RUST.

 <p>With nearly twelve years of professional experience under my belt, I have continually honed my expertise and knowledge.
    I invite you to explore my <a href="https://github.com/MallikarjunTirlapur">GitHub</a> repository, where I openly share my hobby projects. Beyond the realm of coding,
	I have cultivated a multifaceted set of interests that includes Badminton, Yoga, Cycling, and Hiking.
