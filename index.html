 <p>I am a graduate student and pursuing M.Sc in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.h-da.de/">Hochschule Darmstadt</a>. I have worked at <a href="http://www.microchip.com/">Microchip Technology Inc, Bangalore</a> as an Application Engineer for more than 3 years and gained professional experience in embedded system development, SoC validation and characterization. I worked at <a href="http://www.kuka-robotics.com/germany/de/">KUKA Roboter GmbH, Augsburg</a> as a research intern and master thesis student for 1 year. </p>


<p>Being passionate about technology, I build embedded applications as a hobby. I believe in learning and sharing the knowledge is the key for continuous growth. I appreciate contribution, and try to release as much code as possible from my hobby project on my <a href="https://github.com/MallikarjunTirlapur">github</a> site. Yoga, Cooking, Movies, Cycling, Chess are my hobbies. Apart from these, I love travelling, hiking, and spending time with friends.</p>
