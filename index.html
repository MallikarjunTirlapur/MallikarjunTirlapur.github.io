 <p>I am an Embedded Software Developer currently working at Infineon Technologies AG, Augsburg, Germany. 
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.h-da.de/">Hochschule Darmstadt</a> in Feb 2016, with a Masterâ€™s in Electrical Engineering. 
  Prior to masters I worked at <a href="http://www.microchip.com/">Microchip Technology Inc, Bangalore</a> as an Application Engineer for more than 3 years. 
  Also I did my 6 month research internship and wrote master thesis at <a href="http://www.kuka-robotics.com/germany/de/">KUKA Roboter GmbH, Augsburg</a>. </p>


<p>Being passionate towards latest technologies, I build embedded systems as hobby. 
 I try to release as much code as possible from my hobby project on my <a href="https://github.com/MallikarjunTirlapur">github</a> site as I believe that learning and sharing the knowledge is the key for continuous growth.
