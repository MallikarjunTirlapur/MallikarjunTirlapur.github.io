 <p>I am an Embedded Software Developer currently working at Infineon Technologies AG, Augsburg, Germany. 
  In Feb 2016, I graduated from <a href="https://www.h-da.de/">Hochschule Darmstadt</a> with  Masters in Electrical Engineering. 
  Prior to masters I worked at <a href="http://www.microchip.com/">Microchip Technology Inc, Bangalore</a> as an Application Engineer for more than 3 years.
