<p>In this post, I will be talking about the IOT system which updates microcontroller firmware over the air through Bluetooth enabled android device. The system is just a proof of concept.</p>



<h3> Use Cases I imagined </h3>
1.&ensp;Updating firmware of distributed embedded devices by sitting at one central location. For instance, <br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; If embedded device is located thousand kilo meters far away from the central location, embedded device manufacturer must be able to update device firmware by sending the firmware to userâ€™s android/ios device. <br />
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;     Ex: Bluetooth enabled - headphone, speakers, home automation system, television etc<br />

2.&ensp;Program PIC without using Microchip programmer/debugger. <br/>

<p>These 2 use cases motivated me building this small system.</p>
  
<p>The system consists of PIC microcontroller, android device and Bluetooth interface module.  This post would be focusing on PIC18f microcontroller boot loader, Android application, and implementation of them.</p>
  
<h3>PIC Boot Loader </h3>
<p>Boot loader is a special firmware loaded into the microcontroller. The boot loader receives application binaries externally via one of the microcontroller serial port and loads it into the pre-determined section of the flash as shown in the figure 1.1.  In this project, USART has been employed for getting binaries in.</p>
